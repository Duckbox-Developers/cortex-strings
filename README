= Cortex-A String Routines =

This package contains optimised string routines including memcpy(),
memset(), strcpy(), strlen(), and strcmp() for the ARM Cortex-A series
of processors.  Variants are available for the Cortex-A8 and
Cortex-A9, as well as variants that make use of the optional NEON
unit.

== Getting started ==
These routines can be used either stand-alone or as a GLIBC add-on.

To use them stand-alone, first configure and then install
libcortex-strings.so.  To make other applications use this library, either
add -lcortex-strings to the link command or use LD_PRELOAD to load the
library into existing applications.

To use them as a GLIBC add-on, first configure and run `make add-on`
to generate cortex-strings.tar.  Extract this into the GLIBC source
directory, enable the add-on using `--enable-add-ons=cortex-strings` and
`--with-cpu=cortex-a9`, build GLIBC, and install.

== Contents ==
 * src/  contains the routines themselves
 * tests/  contains the unit tests
 * reference/  contains reference copies of other ARM-focused
   implementations gathered from around the Internet
 * benchmarks/  contains various benchmarks, tools, and scripts used to
   check and report on the different implementations.

The src directory contains different variants organised by the
implementation they run on and optional features used.  For example:
  * src/thumb-2  contains generic non-NEON routines for all processors
  * src/neon  contains NEON based routines for all processors

== Reference versions ==
reference/ contains versions collected from various popular Open
Source libraries.  These have been modified for use in benchmarking.
Please refer to the individual files for any licensing terms.

The routines were collected from the following releases:
 * EGLIBC 2.13
 * Newlib 1.19.0
 * Bionic android-2.3.5_r1

== Notes and Limitations ==
This is an early release that contains Cortex-A8 with NEON focused
routines.  Most of the implementations have been collected from other
projects and have a variety of licenses and copyright holders.  Future
releases will tidy this up.
